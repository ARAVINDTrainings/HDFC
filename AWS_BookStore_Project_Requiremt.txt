BookStore  Application Steps
-------------------------------
1)As its a web application we need web Runtime,
  
  > Install Apache webserver

    > yum install httpd -y

  > We need PHP for rendering Application
  
    > yum install php -y

  > Dependencies for Application
   
    > yum install php-mysql -y

  > Install Git to clone code from Git repo
  
    > yum install git -y

  > clone application code to /var/www/html
  
    > git clone https://github.com/ARCDevopsAWS/Bookstore-Php.git  /var/www/html

  > My Application needs Database to store Books info like Title,Author & Price
  
    > Setup an RDS instance

  > Update the RDS instance - DNS Endpoint ,Username & Password in /var/www/html/php/db.php in line 4,5,6

  > As an AWS Architect  ,setup following best practices for my Application 

  > I want best Security Practise for my Application Architecture


     > I want everything to be running in PRIVATE SUBNETS
           > My Application Servers (Public subnet)

           > My Database servers   (Private subnet)

     > Client needs security from ADMINISTRATIVE perspective
     
           > BASTION , NAT

     > Though my Application and DB are in PRIVATE infra when the END-USER wants to access my application they should be 
        accessing from WWW i.e, INTERNET

           >  END-USER should access the application though its in private

     >  For the above application implement HIGH AVAILABILITY
     
           > At any point of time ,i shouldn't be having DOWNTIME

     >  For the above application implement FAULT TOLERANCE
     
           > Ability to heal itself if the things go wrong

           > For Application ,If i Stop/Terminate my webserver they should automatically setup the entire application and also retrieve  data from DB.

     >  Setup Scalability for Book Store  Application

           >When CPU is beyond 90% ,then add an instance with Bookstore application 

           >When cpu is less than 10 % then remove an instance
